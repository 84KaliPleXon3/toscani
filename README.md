Single-Field Credit Card Input
=======

This is a jQuery-based, progressively-enhanced solution for creating a [single-field credit card input](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1667). The idea is to create a more streamlined credit card entry process.

This project, while an interesting experiement, was never meant for production, and yet the amount of love I got for this idea has been astounding. If anyone wants to take it over, I'm all ears. I haven't been able to work on this for years and the project, where I'm concerned, is dead. Thanks for all the interest.
